# DjangoStructural
Structural Engineering Calculators Web App

# Introduction
I am a Structural Engineer from Sydney Australia and currently self-learning Python. 
I am looking at building a Django web application that has a series of useful calculators that are used everyday for the practicing structural egineer. Project is currently under development. 

## Setup
The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

> $ git clone https://github.com/daveh07/DjangoStructural.git
> $ cd DjangoStructural

> Py Version: Python 3.8

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it


Install Django (If not already installed)
After youâ€™ve created and activated a virtual environment, enter the command:

> $ python -m pip install Django

Or, if an error occurs - try:
> $ pip3 install Django

Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies:

> (env)$ cd project
> (env)$ python manage.py runserver

Any issues above, please refer to official Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/

## Contributions
Please feel free to add any contributions even if you are not a structural engineer! This can include any front-end & UI design, UX, docmentation, etc.
