# DjangoStructural
Structural Engineering Calculators Web App

# Introduction
I am a Structural Engineer from Sydney Australia and currently self-teaching myself Python. 
I am looking at building a Django web application that has a series of useful calculators that are used everyday for the practicing structural egineer.  

## Setup
The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/daveh07/DjangoStructural.git
$ cd DjangoStructural

Py Version: Python 3.8

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it


Install Django (If not already installed)
After youâ€™ve created and activated a virtual environment, enter the command:
$ python -m pip install Django

Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies:

(env)$ cd project
(env)$ python manage.py runserver

Any issues above, please refer to Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/

## Contributions
Please feel free to contribute if you woud , even if you are not a structural engineer! Plenty of oppoutinity to contribute to front-end, UI, docmentation, etc
Other engineers using various international codes or calculations of typical engineering section properties
